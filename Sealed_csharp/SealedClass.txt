Sealed Class:
--------------

Why a sealed class?
----------------------

1) On a class that implements security features, so that the original object cannot be 
"impersonated".


2) To limit the inheritance to the places where it really made full sense, because it 
becomes expensive performance-wise if left untreated.The sealed keyword tells the CLR 
that there is no class further down to look for methods, and that speeds things up.

3) NOTE: In most perfomance-enhancing tools on the market nowadays, you will find a 
checkbox that will seal all your classes that aren't inherited. Be careful though, 
because if you want to allow plugins or assembly discovery through MEF, 
you will run into problems.
